# Task Description

Your task is to implement a simple GUI for a "Service Dashboard" application in React.js.

The application should visualize data about services (name, IP address, and list of servers per each service). The desired layout is sketched on image: `./service-dashboard.jpg`:

![Alt text](./service-dashboard.jpg "Title")

The data about services should be fetched from a server. We prepared one for you. You can find it in the `./mock-server` directory.

The `./service-dashboard` folder contains the React project (created with CRA) so you can start your work there.

It's up to you to tune the GUI up.

You can get some extra points for not using any additional dependencies (except fetching library).
